# When included it adds the nested_set behaviour scoped by the attribute
# 'root_id'
#
# AwesomeNestedSet offers being scoped but does not handle inserting and
# updating with the scoped being set right. This module adds this.
#
# When being scoped, we no longer have one big set over the the entire table
# but a forest of sets instead.
#
# The idea of this extension is to always place the node in the correct set
# before standard awesome_nested_set does something. This is necessary as all
# awesome_nested_set methods check for the scope. Operations crossing the
# border of a set are not supported.
#
# One goal of this implementation is to avoid using move_to of
# awesome_nested_set so that the callbacks defined for move_to (:before_move,
# :after_move and :around_move) can safely be used.
