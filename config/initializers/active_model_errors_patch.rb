  # ActiveRecord errors do provide no means to access the symbols initially used to create an
  # error. E.g. errors.add :foo, :bar instantly translates :bar, making it hard to write code
  # dependent on specific errors (which we use in the APIv3).
  # We therefore add a second information store containing pairs of [symbol, translated_message].
