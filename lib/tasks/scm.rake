When using managed repositories of the vendor #{vendor}, OpenProject will not create
repositories whose associated project identifier is contained in the list above.

To resolve these cases, you can either:

1. Remove the affected repositories if they are only remnants of earlier projects

2. Move them out of the OpenProject managed directory '#{managed}'

3. Create an associated project and linking that repository
   as existing through the Frontend.
