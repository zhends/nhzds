# Goes through all attachments looking for ones whose 'file' column, which is the new column
# used by the carrierwave-based attachments, is not set.
#
# For every one of those attachments the migration then sets the 'file' column to
# whatever the value of the legacy column 'filename' is. If that one is empty too
# it falls back to the 'disk_filename' column. This one was not meant to be displayed
# to users but it's better than nothing, especially when trying to identify corrupt attachments.
#
# If *that* column is empty too, the attachment is broken beyond repair and will be dropped.
#
# Note: Just because the 'file' column is restored doesn't mean the actual file exists.
#       Rather the 'file' column being empty means precisely that the file is missing.
#       By still writing the filename into the file column the attachment can at least
#       be displayed, if not downloaded.
#
# Important: The migration is irreversible.
