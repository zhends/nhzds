# Group Previewing

Throughout OpenProject user input for many properties can be formatted (e.g. using *Textile*).
Using the appropriate rendering endpoint it is possible to render custom formatted inputs into HTML and thus
receive a preview of the rendered text.

The request to a rendering endpoint must always have a MIME-Type of `text/plain`.
The request body is the actual string that shall be rendered as HTML string.

## Textile [/api/v3/render/textile{?context}]

+ Model
    + Body

            <p>Hello world! <a href="http://example.com">This</a> <strong>is</strong> textile!</p>

## Preview Textile document [POST]

+ Parameters
    + context (optional, string, `/api/v3/work_packages/42`)
        API-Link to the context in which the rendering occurs, for example a specific work package.

        If left out only context-agnostic rendering takes place.
        Please note that OpenProject features textile-extensions that can only work given a context (e.g. display attached images).

        **Supported contexts:**

        * `/api/v3/work_packages/{id}` - an existing work package

+ Request (text/plain)

            Hello world! "This":http://example.com *is* textile!

+ Response 200 (text/html)

    [Textile][]

+ Response 400 (application/json)

    Returned if the context passed by the client is not valid (e.g. unknown).

    Note that this response will also occur when the requesting user
    is not allowed to see the context resource (e.g. limited work package visibility).
