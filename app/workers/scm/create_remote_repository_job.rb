# Provides an asynchronous job to create a managed repository on a remote system
# using a simple HTTP callback
# Currently, this is run synchronously due to potential issues
# with error handling.
# We envision a repository management wrapper that covers transactional
# creation and deletion of repositories BOTH on the database and filesystem.
# Until then, a synchronous process is more failsafe.
