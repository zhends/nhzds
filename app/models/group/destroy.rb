module Group::Destroy
  ##
  # Instead of firing of separate queries for each and every Member and MemberRole
  # instance upon group deletion this implementation does most of the deletion
  # in a hand full of aggregate queries.
  #
  # Instead of doing
  #
  #   Member:
  #     before_destroy :remove_from_category_assignments
  #     after_destroy :unwatch_from_permission_change
  #     after_destroy :destroy_notification
  #
  #   MemberRole:
  #     after_destroy :remove_role_from_group_users
  #
  # for every row all relevant roles are deleted within 5 mass delete queries
  # + 1 query for each member instance for each group itself + number of watchers
  # among the users in the deleted group.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  # Given: 150 projects and 1 group with 20 users which is member in every project
  #
  # That makes 150 * 20 3000 Member rows and also 3000 MemberRole rows.
  #
  # Without this patch this would result in at least 4 queries for each member
  # (the callbacks mentioned above + the deletion of the member) and 2 queries
  # for each MemberRole (callback mentioned above + deletion of the actual MemberRole).
  # Altogether that makes:
  #
  # num_queries_pre_patch = 3000 * 4 + 3000 * 2 + W = 18000 + W
  #
  # Where W is the number of watchers among the users in the destroyed group.
  # The actual number is actually even higher as for the callbacks a bunch of read queries
  # (loading the project, the user, etc.) are triggered, too.
  #
  # With this patch the number of queries is reduced to the 5 + 1 for each group member
  # as explained above, making it:
  #
  # num_queries_post_patch = 5 + 150 + W = 155 + W
  #
