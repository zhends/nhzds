# Modifications:
# - sensible default changed to "application/binary"
# - removed references to paperclip

#
# The content-type detection strategy is as follows:
#
# 1. Blank/Empty files: If there's no filename or the file is empty,
#    provide a sensible default (application/binary or inode/x-empty)
#
# 2. Calculated match: Return the first result that is found by both the
#    `file` command and MIME::Types.
#
# 3. Standard types: Return the first standard (without an x- prefix) entry
#    in MIME::Types
#
# 4. Experimental types: If there were no standard types in MIME::Types
#    list, try to return the first experimental one
#
# 5. Raw `file` command: Just use the output of the `file` command raw, or
#    a sensible default. This is cached from Step 2.
