  Background:
    Given there is 1 project with the following:
      | identifier | project1 |
      | name       | project1 |

    And I am working in project "project1"

    And the project "project1" has the following types:
      | name    | position |
      | Bug     |     1    |
      | Feature |     2    |

    And there is a role "member"

    And the role "member" may have the following rights:
      | view_work_packages |

    And there is 1 user with the following:
      | login | bob |
    And there is 1 user with the following:
      | login | jimmy |

    And the user "bob" is a "member" in the project "project1"
    And the user "jimmy" is a "member" in the project "project1"

    And there are the following issues in project "project1":
      | subject | type    | author | assignee |
      | issue1  | Bug     | bob    | jimmy    |

      | issue5  | Bug     | jimmy  | bob      |
      | issue6  | Feature | jimmy  | bob      |

    And I am already logged in as "bob"

  @javascript @wip
  Scenario: Groupings should be displayed when a grouping is selected
    When I go to the work packages index page of the project "project1"
    And I click "settingsDropdown"
    And I click "Group by â€¦"
    And I select "Type" from the select2 dropdown
    Then I should see "(3)" within "#group-header-Bug .count"
