        | view_changesets    |
    When I go to the page of the work package "wp1"
    Then I should see the following changesets:
        | revision | comments |
        | 1        | blubs    |

  @javascript

    Given the role "manager" may have the following rights:
        | view_work_packages |
    When I go to the page of the work package "wp1"
    # Safeguard to ensure the page is loaded
    Then I should see "wp1" within ".wp-edit-field.subject"
    Then I should not be presented changesets
