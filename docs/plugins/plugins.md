# Plugins

## Install plugins
You can install plugins for the following installation methods:

* [Install plugins - packaged installation](https://www.openproject.org/plugins/install-plugins-packaged/)
* [Install plugins - manual installation](https://www.openproject.org/plugins/install-plugins-manual/)

## Develop plugins

We encourage you to extend OpenProject yourself by writing a plugin. Please, read the [plugin-contributions](https://www.openproject.org/develope-openproject/create-openproject-plugin/) guide for more information.

If you are a plugin author and want your plugins to be listed here, leave us a note in our [forums](https://community.openproject.org/projects/openproject/boards), via [twitter](https://twitter.com/openproject) or any other communication channel. We're looking forward to your contribution.

Please note that the plugin author is responsible to keep his plugin up to date with OpenProject development. In case a plugin causes errors, please contact the plugin author and/or write in our support forums. We will remove plugins from this page if we notice that they are not maintained.

## Supported plugins
Supported plugins are compatible with the current OpenProject version. When a plugin has a dependency to another plugin it is necessary that you list both plugins in the Gemfile.plugins.
