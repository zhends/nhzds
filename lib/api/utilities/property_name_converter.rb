module API

    # Since APIv3 uses different names for some properties, there is sometimes the need to convert
    # names between the "old" Rails/ActiveRecord world of names and the "new" APIv3 world of names.
    # This class provides methods to cope with the neccessary name conversions
    # There are multiple reasons for naming differences:
    #  - APIv3 is using camelCase as opposed to snake_case
    #  - APIv3 defines some properties as a different type, which requires a name change
    #     e.g. estimatedTime vs estimated_hours (AR: hours; API: generic duration)
    #  - some names used in AR are even there kind of deprecated
    #     e.g. fixed_version, which everyone refers to as version
    #  - some names in AR are plainly inconsistent, whereas the API tries to be as consistent as
    #    possible, e.g. updated_at vs updated_on
    #
    # Callers note: While this class is envisioned to be generally usable, it is currently solely
    # used for purposes around work packages. Further work might be required for conversions to make
    # sense in different contexts.
