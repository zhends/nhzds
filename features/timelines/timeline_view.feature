Feature: Timeline View Tests
	As a Project Member
	I want to view the timeline data
	change the timeline selection

  Background:
    Given there is 1 user with:
          | login | manager |
      And there is a role "manager"
      And the role "manager" may have the following rights:
          | view_timelines |
          | edit_timelines |
      And there is a project named "ecookbook"
      And I am working in project "ecookbook"
      And the project uses the following modules:
          | timelines |
      And the user "manager" is a "manager"
      And I am already logged in as "manager"

  Scenario: The project manager gets 'No data to display' when there are no planning elements defined
     When I go to the page of the timeline of the project called "ecookbook"
     Then I should see "New timeline report"
      And I should see "General Settings"

  Scenario: Creating a timeline
     When there is a timeline "Testline" for project "ecookbook"
     When I go to the page of the timeline "Testline" of the project called "ecookbook"
     Then I should see "Timeline report" within ".toolbar-items"
      And I should see "Testline"
      And I should be on the page of the timeline "Testline" of the project called "ecookbook"

  @javascript
  Scenario: name column width
     When there is a timeline "Testline" for project "ecookbook"
      And I go to the page of the timeline "Testline" of the project called "ecookbook"
      And I wait for timeline to load table
     Then the first table column should not take more than 25% of the space

  @javascript
  Scenario: switch timeline
    When there is a timeline "Testline" for project "ecookbook"
      And there is a timeline "Testline2" for project "ecookbook"
      And I go to the page of the project called "ecookbook"
      And I follow "Timelines"
      And I select "Testline2" from "Timeline report"
     Then I should see "Timeline report" within ".toolbar-items"
      And I should see "Testline2"
      And I should be on the page of the timeline "Testline2" of the project called "ecookbook"
