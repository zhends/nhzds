  # on the login page and in the login drop down menu.

  # With his configuration option you can set a specific omniauth provider to be
  # used for direct login. Meaning that the login provider selection is skipped and
  # the configured provider is used directly instead.

  # If this option is active /login will lead directly to the configured omniauth provider
  # and so will a click on 'Sign in' (as opposed to opening the drop down menu).
