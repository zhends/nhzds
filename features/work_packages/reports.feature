Feature: Navigating from reports to index
  Background:
    Given there is 1 project with the following:
      | name        | parent      |
      | identifier  | parent      |
    And I am working in project "parent"
    And the project "parent" has the following types:
      | name | position |
      | Bug  |     1    |
    And there is a role "member"
    And the role "member" may have the following rights:
      | view_work_packages |
      | edit_work_packages |
    And there is 1 user with the following:
      | login | bob|
    And the user "bob" is a "member" in the project "parent"
    And I am already logged in as "bob"

  Scenario: Navigating from work package reports back to work package overview
    When I go to the work_packages/report page of the project called "parent"
    And I follow "Work packages" within "#main-menu"
    Then I should be on the work packages index page of the project called "parent"

  Scenario: Navigating from work package reports page to a type report
    When I go to the work_packages/report page of the project called "parent"
    And  I follow "Further analyze: Type"
    Then I should see "Bug" within ".generic-table"
