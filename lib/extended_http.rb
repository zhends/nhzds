  # Use this in response to an HTTP POST (or PUT), telling the client where the
  # new resource is.  Works just like redirect_to, but sends back a 303 (See
  # Other) status code.  Redirects should be used to tell the client to repeat
  # the same request on a different resource, and see_other when we want the
  # client to follow a POST (on this resource) with a GET (to the new resource).
  #
  # This is especially useful for successful create actions.
