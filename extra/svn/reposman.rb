[DEPRECATION] The functionality provided by reposman.rb has been integrated into OpenProject.
Please remove any existing cronjobs that still use this script.

You can create repositories explicitly on the filesystem using managed repositories.
Enable managed repositories for each SCM vendor individually using the templates
defined in configuration.yml.

If you want to convert existing repositories previously created (by reposman.rb or manually)
into managed repositories, use the following command:

    $ bundle exec rake scm:migrate:managed[URL prefix (, URL prefix, ...)]
Where URL prefix denotes a common prefix of repositories whose status should be upgraded to :managed.
Example:

If you have executed reposman.rb with the following parameters:

  $ reposman.rb [...] --svn-dir "/opt/svn" --url "file:///opt/svn"

Then you can pass a URL prefix of 'file:///opt/svn' and the rake task will migrate all repositories
matching this prefix to :managed.
You may pass more than one URL prefix to the task.
