Feature: Type Administration
  As an OpenProject Admin
  I want to configure which types are available
  So that I can support my teams with useful settings while still controlling
  the total number of available types
  So that my teams can work effectively

  Background:
    Given there are the following types:
          | Name            | Is Milestone | In aggregation | Is Standard |
          | Phase           | false        | true           | false       |
          | Milestone       | true         | true           | false       |
          | Minor Phase     | false        | false          | false       |
          | Minor Milestone | true         | false          | false       |
          | Standard        | true         | false          | true        |
      And I am already admin

  Scenario: The admin may see all types within the admin UI
     When I go to the global index page of types
     Then I should see that "Phase" is not a milestone and shown in aggregation
      And I should see that "Milestone" is a milestone and shown in aggregation
      And I should see that "Minor Phase" is not a milestone and not shown in aggregation
      And I should see that "Minor Milestone" is a milestone and not shown in aggregation

  Scenario: The admin may create a type
     When I go to the global index page of types
      And I follow "New type"
      And I fill in "New Phase" for "Name"
      And I press "Create"
     Then I should see a notice flash stating "Successful creation."
     When I go to the global index page of types
      And I should see that "New Phase" is not a milestone and shown in aggregation
      And "New Phase" should be the last element in the list

  Scenario: Nice error messages help fixing them
     When I go to the global index page of types
      And I follow "New type"
      And I fill in "" for "Name"
      And I press "Create"
     Then I should see an error explanation stating "Name can't be blank"

  Scenario: The admin may edit a type
     When I go to the edit page of the type called "Phase"
      And I fill in "Updated Phase" for "Name"
      And I press "Save"
     Then I should see a notice flash stating "Successful update."
     When I go to the global index page of types
     Then I should see that "Updated Phase" is not a milestone and shown in aggregation

  Scenario: The admin may delete a type
     When I go to the global index page of types
      And I follow "Delete Minor Phase"
     Then I should see a notice flash stating "Successful deletion."
      And I should not see the "Minor Phase" type

  Scenario: The admin may reorder types
     When I go to the global index page of types
      And I move "Minor Phase" to the top
     Then "Minor Phase" should be the first element in the list

     When I move "Minor Phase" down by one
     Then "Phase" should be the first element in the list

  Scenario: A standard type cannot be deleted
     When I go to the global index page of types
     Then "Standard" should be the last element in the list
      And I should not see "Delete" in the same table row as "Standard"
